# DrowningToast's neovim config

Copied [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/neovimrc) Neovim config and modified it to suits my taste.

Use lazy for package manager.

# Remap:

- `leader` as a space

## Normal mode
- `<leader>pv` opens :Ex
- `n` on search, keep the search term in the middle.
- `N` on search, keep the search term in the middle.
- `Q` remaps to doing nothing.
- `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` to navigate through the file quickly while keeping the cursor on the center.
- `<leader>h` replaces all appearance in the file
- `<leader>x` turns the current file into an executable
- ``<leader>` `` toggle show the errors and warning in the project.

## Visual Mode
- `J` and `K` move the selected line vertically
- `<leader>p` on pastes, keep the yanked text instead of the replaced text.
- `<leader>Y` yanks the selected, and copied it into the clip board.
